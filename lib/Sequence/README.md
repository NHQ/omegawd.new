#Sequence - The jQuery Slider Plugin with Infinite Style
Sequence is the jQuery slider plugin with infinite style. It provides the complete functionality for a website slider without forcing you to use a set theme. In fact, Sequence has no in-built theme, leaving you complete creative control to build a unique slider using only CSS3 -- no jQuery knowledge required!

##Features
- Unique transition styles created using CSS3
- Supports all modern browsers
- Gracefully degrades in older browsers*
- Supports responsive layouts
- Supports touch devices and swiping
- Many developer features with even more to come
- Semantic and easy to use markup
- Open source

*Tested down to Firefox 3.6 and IE7. Extensive support details to come

##What's New? (v0.2 28/02/2012)

###Preloader
Sequence now has a default preloader or support for a custom preloader. When preloading is complete, a class of "preloading-complete" can be added to one or multiple elements to allow you to write your own reveal using CSS3 transitions. Also comes with a callback for when the preloading is complete.

###Cycle Option
Choose whether Sequence should go back to the start when it reaches the last frame (or the first frame if navigating backwards)

###reverseAnimationsWhenNavigatingBackwards Option
When navigating backwards, you can now specify whether frames should animate forwards or in reverse
